# Vision

The vision section describes **what** kind of decentralized technologies and
financial primitives Fortress aims to represent. The end goal for Fortress is to
be a decentralized financial platform providing an entire toolbox for
sophisticated passive investors in the DeFi ecosystem.

Passive investors, seen as class of financial market participants, usually
operate on the basis of long time horizons and are able to withstand short term
volatility. Fortress will allow passive investors to "set and forget" individual
investment strategies.
