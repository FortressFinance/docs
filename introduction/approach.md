# Approach

The approach section describes **how** Fortress aims to achieve its vision of
building decentralized technologies and financial primitives in the DeFi
ecosystem. Fortress is maintained by independent contributors that organize in
more or less decentralized ways under the principle of least privilege access
and other best practices of information security available, like multi signature
wallets. 

In general, Fortress will always dog food its own financial products. By
leveraging the very same infrastructure publicly available, Fortress ensures
that the same benefits apply for both its users and its own treasury.
