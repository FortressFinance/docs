# Approach

The approach section describes **how** Fortress aims to achieve its vision of building decentralized technologies and financial primitives in the DeFi ecosystem. Fortress is maintained by independent contributors that organize in more or less decentralized ways under the principle of least privilege access and other best practices of information security available, like multi signature wallets.

In general, Fortress will always dog food its own financial products. By leveraging the very same infrastructure publicly available, Fortress ensures that the same benefits apply for both its users and its own treasury.

Fortress is standing on the shoulders of giants like [Curve](https://curve.fi) and [Balancer](https://balancer.fi). Fortress has the most conviction in these kind of Tripple-A grade DeFi protocols and wants to see them win long term. Therefore, Fortress aims to add more utility to partner protocols and their users by providing passive liquidity based strategies. (_insert elephant-sucking-his-own-cock-meme_)
