The greater philosophy of Fortress' system design is to focus on the dichotomy between user experience and decentralization guarantees. The focus on user experience should result in frictionless usage, while the focus on decentralization guarantees should result in censorship resistance and thus fair operation in terms of free markets. The diagram below illustrates the topological technology stack of the Fortress protocol with the individual user at the top of usage entrypoint.
