* Vault Asset: GLP
* Vault Shares: fortGLP
* Strategy: GLP is being staked in GMX, earning more esGMX and multiplier points
  from GMX traders and swappers. The earned esGMX is never vested but instead
  used to boost earnings for more native tokens. The earned multiplier points
  also boost earnings for more native tokens. The vault claims rewards
  periodically, swaps rewards to the chosen asset contained in the GLP basket
  and mints additional GLP to further earn more fees.
